Sunshine everyday (sunshine everyday)
I think I'm gonna stay
I've always wondered what it's all about
It could be it's my scene
And now's the time, I'm gonna check it out
And really live the California dream
It's almost magic
There's something in the air

On the beach (bop-bop on the beach)
Something's just begun (on the beach)
You can reach (bop-bop, you can reach)
Out and find the one on the beach
Bop-bop on the beach
You can always find your dreams
This place is happening and I must admit
I really dig it now
And though at first, I feel I didn't fit
You know I'll make my lucky break somehow
Ooh
And when it happens
I know I'll take my chance

On the beach (bop-bop on the beach)
California sun (On the beach)
You can reach (bop-bop, you can reach)
Out and find someone on the beach

Bop-bop, on the beach
It can happen on the beach
Bop bop, on the beach
Something's just begun (on the beach)
You can reach (bop-bop, you can reach)
Out and find the one on the beach
Bop-bop, on the beach
You can always find your dreams

Bop-bop on the beach
California sun
Bop-bop, you can reach
Out and find someone
Bop-bop on the beach
California sun
Bop-bop on the beach
Bop-bop on the beach
(On the beach) Bop-bop on the beach
Bop-bop on the beach
(On the beach) Bop-bop on the beach
Bop-bop on the beach
(On the beach)
